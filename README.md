# Esubsidi Web Platform
E Subsidi (Electronic Social Assistance) is a web application that provides citizen data management who will receive social assistance to avoid misdirection assistance from public service/government.

This project was initiated by Annisa and her friends, who are currently majoring in State Development Administration, to examine the effectiveness of using information systems to implement subsidy distribution in the local district.
